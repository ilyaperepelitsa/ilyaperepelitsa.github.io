   <p> There is no way to embed a map in a div and specify its width in % - whenever I try, it breaks (map isn't displayed).</p>

   <h1> Homework Mar 8. </h1>
   <p> I couldn't finish all the things that I had in mind for some pages. I'm still working on that social media spans. Also, active links behave in some way that I don't know how to control yet</p>
   <p> I did succeed in spacing the index page columns correctly - now they span the entire page. I also worked with colors however I discarded some nav background color code. I want to create semi-transparent shapes with css and I haven't figured that out completely.</p>
   <p>Last thing for the main page that did work is importing Google fonts although that was relatively straigtforward.</p>
   <h1>Now the map CSS inserts:</h1>
   <p> I didn't have any popups for the map and it took some time to figure out how to add changes that actually make sense and aren't simply an exercise in using CSS (although I do have a bit of that too which I'm going to mention later).</p>
 <p>Mainly I played with the legend fonts - I changed the font size, limited the width of UL element and aligned text labels to the markers using absolute positioning. I also played a bit with inserting an image and aligning it with the UL element using left float and that didn't work out for some reason

   <h1> Origins of this project. </h1>
   <p> So I decided to learn CV and NLP durinng my last semester at the New School.
     Though it would be fun to learn something new.</p>
   <p> The idea is to track someone down - in this case ISIS. Once I set up the scraper
   I will expand the project to looking for neo-nazis in Russia. The main idea is to track
 someone when you don't know whom you're looking for.</p>
   <p>Besides just finding images that look like ISIS flags I want to look into their previous
     tweets and the tweet that contained an image. The goal here is to determine how to
   distinguish supporters from News media, critics and so on.</p>
   <p>I will scrape twitter to identify ISIS supporters:</p>

   <h1> Placeholder map. </h1>
   <p>See next map for assignment part 1. I just like this map more and I also wanted to play with screen resolution and div width.</p>
   <p>My memory is a bit rusty but it seems like the basics do work (although I had to copy all css code). The next step would be a
   good cascading setup of selectors to make sure I don't need to copy CSS code.</p>
