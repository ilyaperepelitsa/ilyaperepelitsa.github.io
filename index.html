     <h1> Origins of this project. </h1>
     <p> So I decided to learn CV and NLP durinng my last semester at the New School.
       Though it would be fun to learn something new.</p>
     <p> The idea is to track someone down - in this case ISIS. Once I set up the scraper
     I will expand the project to looking for neo-nazis in Russia. The main idea is to track
   someone when you don't know whom you're looking for.</p>
     <p>Besides just finding images that look like ISIS flags I want to look into their previous
       tweets and the tweet that contained an image. The goal here is to determine how to
     distinguish supporters from News media, critics and so on.</p>
     <p>I will scrape twitter to identify ISIS supporters:</p>

     <h1> Placeholder map. </h1>
     <p>See next map for assignment part 1. I just like this map more and I also wanted to play with screen resolution and div width.</p>
     <p>My memory is a bit rusty but it seems like the basics do work (although I had to copy all css code). The next step would be a
     good cascading setup of selectors to make sure I don't need to copy CSS code.</p>
