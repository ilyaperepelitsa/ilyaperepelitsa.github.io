     <h1> Origins of this project. </h1>
     <p> So I decided to learn CV and NLP durinng my last semester at the New School.
       Though it would be fun to learn something new.</p>
     <p> The idea is to track someone down - in this case ISIS. Once I set up the scraper
     I will expand the project to looking for neo-nazis in Russia. The main idea is to track
   someone when yod don't know whom you're looking for.</p>
     <p>I will scrape twitter and identify these to identify ISIS supporters:</p>
